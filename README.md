# Portfolio-Website-Project
completed the portfolio website project using html and pure css
*one of the new feature of css i learned is clip-path by which i can create various polygon shapes easily by giving coordinate values pairwise
the project is purely based on css but can modify it by using various libraries like locomotive for smooth scrolling and gsap for some amazing animations
